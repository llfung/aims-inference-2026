# Inference with AI (Week 3)
This repo stores all the teaching material for Week 3 of the AI in Science at AIMS programme.

The directories are organised by sessions. Each session directory contains the lecture slides and any accompanying notebooks. 

We will add the project material on Wednesday 18th February after the lectures have concluded.
